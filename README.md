### Hello, I'm **Amit Peled**

# About Me:

Iâ€™m a data scientist with a background in bioengineering and a **Masterâ€™s in Data Science from the University of Washington**.

My work has taken me across industries, from helping the **Oklahoma City Thunder** make data-driven performance decisions, to supporting pediatric healthcare research at **Seattle Childrenâ€™s Hospital**, where I co-authored a study published in *JAMA*. Iâ€™m especially interested in using data science to solve meaningful, real-world problems, whether that is through building scalable systems, improving decision-making, or simply uncovering patterns.

I enjoy all the aspects of working across the full data pipeline: cleaning and structuring messy data, applying statistical and machine learning models, and communicating results clearly to both technical and non-technical teams. Tools I regularly work with include Python, R, SQL, AWS, and Azure.

Right now, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities where I can keep learning, contribute to impactful projects, and grow as part of a collaborative team.

Feel free to reach out â€” Iâ€™m always open to connecting.
